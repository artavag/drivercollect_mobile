If there is anything which you do not understand, or if you wish to obtain further information, please contact our Customer Services team on.</p>
							<p>Product images are for illustrative purposes only and may differ from the actual product.</p>
							<p>We make every effort to ensure that the pricing displayed on our website is correct. However, if an error in the pricing of a product is found we reserve the right to either cancel your order or contact you to arrange payment of any extra sum due or refund any over-payment made by you (as applicable). We reserve the right to alter all product pricing without notice.</p>
							<p>All prices include VAT (where applicable) at the current rates. We reserve the right to express the price exclusive of VAT, but we shall show VAT separately and include it in the total price.</p>
							<p>Where we charge separately for packing, carriage and insurance and other relevant charges, the appropriate rates are set out in our specified pricing structure shown elsewhere on this Website.</p>

							<h2>Placing an order</h2>
							<p>You are deemed to place an order with us by ordering via our online checkout process. As part of our checkout process you will be given the opportunity to check your order and to correct any errors. We will send you an order acknowledgement, detailing the products you have ordered.</p>
							<p>The contract is subject to your right of cancellation (see below).</p>
							<p>Any order placed by you for goods advertised on our website is an offer by you to purchase the goods selected in your order. No contract exists between you and us for the sale of any goods until we have received your order and accepted it (which we may do at our discretion).  Our acceptance of an order takes place when we despatch the order or send you confirmation by email even if your payment has been processed immediately.</p>
							<p>We may refuse in our discretion to accept an order:</p>

							<ul>
								<li><span class="ulicon">(a)</span><span>where we cannot obtain authorisation for your payment.</span></li>
								<li><span class="ulicon">(b)</span><span>if there has been a pricing or product description error; or</span></li>
								<li><span class="ulicon">(c)</span><span>if you do not meet any eligibility criteria set out in our terms and conditions.</span></li>
								<li><span class="ulicon">(d)</span><span>where goods ordered by you are not available;</span></li>
								<li><span class="ulicon">(e)</span><span> if we do not deliver to your area;</span></li>
							</ul>

							<p>Where we do not accept your order but have processed your payment, we will re-credit your account with any amount deducted by us from your debit or credit card as soon as possible, but in any event within 30 days of your order. We will not be obliged to pay any additional amount as compensation for disappointment.</p>
							<p>You must observe and comply with all applicable regulations and legislation, including obtaining all necessary customs, import or other permits to purchase goods from our site. The importation or exportation of certain of our goods to you may be prohibited by certain national laws. We make no representation and accept no liability in respect of the export or import of the goods you purchase.</p>

							<h2>Payment</h2>
							<p>Payment can be made by any of the options advertised on our website. Payment shall be due before delivery. If payment fails your order will be cancelled. There will be no delivery until clear funds have been received.</p>
							<p>Payment online: Our secure server software encrypts all your payment card details. The process scrambles all the information, allowing no unauthorised third party to intercept the data. Your browser will confirm that you are shopping in a secure environment by showing either a locked padlock icon or an image of a padlock next to the payment details in the relevant area of the Website.</p>
							<p>To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases.</p>
							<p>By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information.

All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. During security checks we may ask for additional information or documentation to help support the data you supplied.</p>
							<p>Please be aware that if you are using Paypal as your payment method we reserve the right to not ship to unconfirmed addresses.

							<h2>Delivery</h2>
							<p>We will deliver goods ordered by you as soon as possible to the address you give us for delivery, but in any event within days of your order. However we reserve the Right not to make deliveries outside the United Kingdom unless our ordering form provides that facility.</p>
							<p>Upon receipt of your order you will be asked to sign for the goods received in good condition. If the package does not appear to be in good condition then please refuse the delivery. If you are unable to check the contents of your delivery at the point of delivery then please sign for the parcel as "UNCHECKED". Failure to do so may affect any warranty claims that you make thereafter.</p>
							<p>If the goods we deliver are not what you ordered or are damaged or defective or the delivery is of an incorrect quantity, we shall have no liability to you unless you notify us in writing, at our contact address, of the problem within working days of the delivery of the goods in question.</p>
							<p>If you do not receive goods ordered by you within days of the date on which you ordered them, we shall have no liability to you unless you notify us in writing at our contact address of the problem within days from the date on which you ordered the goods.</p>

							<h2>Refund Policy</h2>
							<p>If you are eligible for a refund, we will refund you back to the payment method you used when you originally paid for your order. Please note: It is your responsibility to notify us of any changes to your card details i.e. you no longer have that account. Refunds can take up to 30 days to process.</p>
